**Hello !** I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oslo, affiliated with the [INTRANSIT Research Centre](https://www.sv.uio.no/tik/english/research/centre/intransit/).  
My research explores how executive cognition and communication shape organizational responses to sustainability transitions, business model disruptions, and institutional complexity. I combine qualitative and quantitative methods, with a deep appreciation for theory.

Before entering academia, I spent over a decade working in the energy sector and leading software engineering projects across Europe. This experience informs both my research and my approach to teaching.

I hold a PhD in Strategic Management from ESCP Business School, an MPhil in Linguistics from the University of Cambridge (Selwyn College), and an MSc in Computer Science from Imperial College London.
